# IRCameraView

Get access to your infrared and depth cameras on Windows!

## Download

You can try the [prerelease version](https://github.com/Iemand005/IRCameraView/releases/tag/0.1.1), which includes extra features like frame filtering, or download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Iemand005/IRCameraView/releases/latest).

There are two versions, one built with WinUI and one built with UWP. The WinUI version has Windows 11 design and the UWP version Windows 10.

For reference, the only other example I found on how to do this is: https://github.com/andresbeltranc/ir_camera_sample_win32
